Project Overview
This is a Flask-based web application that scrapes job listings from various job posting websites and displays them in a clean, professional, and mobile-responsive interface. The initial version pulls job postings from BDJobs, showing job titles, company names, locations, and application deadlines.

In future iterations, more renowned job posting websites will be added, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Monster, providing a centralized place for job seekers to browse listings.
